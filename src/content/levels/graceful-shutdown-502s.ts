  blurb: "Most rollout requests succeed, but terminating backends intermittently return 502.",
  story:
    "edge-api reports two healthy replicas and the rollout strategy allows zero unavailable Pods. During every release, roughly one request in three still returns 502. The external route is slower to forget an endpoint than the application is to close its listener.",
  objective:
    "Keep terminating Pods serving long enough for endpoint propagation and eliminate sampled rollout errors.",

    rootCause:
      "The application closed its listener as soon as SIGTERM arrived, while the external route still sent new requests to the terminating endpoint.",
    whyItFailed:
      "Kubernetes begins container termination and endpoint-state propagation concurrently. The terminating endpoint stops being Ready, but an Ingress or external load balancer can lag behind that update. During that window, the old Pod remained externally routable but no longer accepted connections, producing intermittent 502 responses despite healthy replica counts.",
    whatFixedIt:
      "A ten-second preStop delay kept the process serving while routing converged. A fifteen-second total termination grace period left room for the hook and process shutdown. Six-request validation then remained entirely HTTP 200.",
    prevention:
      "Measure real endpoint-propagation latency, budget preStop and termination grace above it, preserve rollout capacity, and sample traffic during termination in release tests.",
